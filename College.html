								<h3>Georgia Gwinnett College (GGC) | 2017-2020</h3>
								<h4>3.1 GPA | Environmental Biology Major </h4>
								<p>Though I was accepted to all of the Universities in the Atlanta area, I chose GGC over Georgia State University or Univeristy of Georgia because, in my opinion, they provided the best education without adding on additional unecessary fees for services I would never use such as, UGA's infamous stadium fees, or GSU's law student board fees. Not only was the education top of the line but the small class sizes really allowed me to get time with my professors without being designated a number and addressed by that number like in GSU's lecture halls. </p>
								<p>
								Why did I major in Biology rather than computer or data science? Well, after leaving the military, I thought the most natural next step is to continue doing medicine. I loved playing with programs on my computer but I never thought of it as more than something fun to do when I was bored because I wasn't sure I was good enough to make anything out of this. So rather than follow my passion, I stuck with the familiar path that would make my parents happy. BIG mistake. </p><hr>

								<h3>Licenses & Certificates</h3>
								<p>Coursera IT certificates have really opened the door to what I could do with my computer. With its self paced classes, I was able to learn methods and skills that i was truly insterested in without having to take unecessary pre-req courses. I plan on obtaining at least one certificat each month so that I can continue to sharpen my skills and be just a little better at my craft with each class I complete. I have also completed courses in SEMRush and Ahrefs for SEO. Some of my certificated include:  </p>
								<ul>
									<li>HTML, CSS, & JavaScript for Web Developers</li>
									<li>Competitive Analysis and Keywork Research .</li>
									<li>On-page and Technical SEO</li>
									<li>SEO Toolkit Exam for advanced SEMRush Users</li>
									
								</ul>
