										<h3>Fiverr/ Upwork</h3>
										<p>After I left the army, I was not interested in attending college right away, in fact, I was hesitant to go back to school due to the agen and experience difference between my classmates and I. I still had to do something for money so I picked up a full time job as an EMT for Atlanta while I picked up a new source of income. That's when i discovered freelancing on websites like Upwork and Fiverr. You mean to tell me that I can work from home and my clientele comes to me??? Where do I sign up!? </p>
										<p>I have always been good with computers so I figured I would try my hand at it. My first inclination was SEO. It seemed like the best avenue to sink my teeth into. I posted my services on Fiverr first and worried about the skills portion as I get to them. My first client was in 2017, Gwinnetthairtransplant.com, a local hair transplant doctor looking to increase his search volume. I managed to get him to the bottom of the first page of google within a month! Unfortunately, I did not see this as a meaningful career opportunity because I focused on becoming a Surgeon to make my family proud. </p>
										<p> My longest running Upwork project was for a website called <a href="https://www.adventurouskate.com/"> Adventurous Kate </a> This was for a former Microsoft employee that quit her job to travel and has never looked back since. My services to her included: 
											<ul>
												<li> SEO </li>
												<li>Blog creation and scheduling</li>
												<li>Social media management</li>
												<li>Email Management</li>
											</ul>

										<a href="#" class="image fit" id="BestLyfeGroup"><img src="images/bestlyfe logo.png" alt="" /></a>
										<h3>BestLyfe Group</h3>
										<p>This is my current place of employment. I was hired at the beginning of 2021 as an SEO and front end developer. I actually had no intent of applying but my best friend who is a back end developer gave me the push I needed to apply to a job I knew I wanted but was to insecure about my skills to actually apply for. I will always be grateful to him for giving the much needed nudge to follow a passion that I wasn't sure I was capable of performing. It is here that I discovered where my skill lie and where I could take them. The positive and inclusive envirnonment within this company gave me the time and encouragement to become better at my craft. I would learn at night and practice what I learned during the day. I started by learning only what was pertinent to make the team succeed but once most of it became second nature, I began to branch out and learn more and more IT skills that I was confident my team would need in the future.  <br><br>
										My resposibilities Include:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>SEO research, analytics, implementation, & reporting.</li>
											<li>Back end responsive web section design</li>
											<li>Front end category and city page design.</li>
											<li>Vlog/content creation</li>
											<li>Client relations & trouble shooting</li>

I've always preffered to spend my time on experiences instead of material posessions I learned the value of money and how money makes more money thanks to my time in the miltary. I used my deployment money to set myself up for a comfortable life with a little left over to experience the world through a motorcycle...  </p>
