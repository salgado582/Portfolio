									<p align=justify>I am a self-taught Web designer and SEO with real world experience as a freelancer and corporate employee. I am passionate about web design because as a task oriented person, I prefer to express my creativity through my work rather my words. Web Design allows me to connect with clients on a personal level and dig through what they think they want to create what they need. <br><br>

                  Below are two of my favorite websites that were recently designed and implimented for some of our clients. </p>

						</header>
						<p align=justify>The Beauty of working for a startup is that you get to wear multiple hats. You get to try multiple roles, work with software you may have never thought of using, and help make decisions that would typically be outside of your job scope. That's what's so amazing, you get to try every hat available before you get to take some of them off. <br><br>
            This Site was originally made by the company founder. It contained a home page, contact us, and package deals. That's it! No optimization, no blogs, no portfolio, nothing! It wasn't until I came onboard that I suggested the site had to be revamped with SEO, new pages, interlinks, and a showcase page that highlights the joint efforts of our team's creativity and skill. <br><br>

            The site has seen massive improvement in traffic and applications for consultations month over month and an increase in clientele and revenue!

							<h2>San Diego Kids Party Rentals</h2>
							<p> Website Redesign, SEO, and Desperately Needed Help Getting Out of FaceBook Jail</p>
						</header>
						<p align=justify>San Diego Kids Party Rentals had massive inventory on their website entirely out of order, every page was a child page to the home page, items were out of categorical order, Website's distorted architecture made Googlebot exclude it from various search queries.<br> <br> 

            This Website was a team effort; My job was to reorganize the site's architecture to make it crawlable without exceeding Google Bot's crawl budget. This was done by reordering all the items to relevant category pages. Each category page was optimized with SEO by including specific keywords, external & internal hyperlinks, unique google maps with drawn delivery radiuss, FAQs, and city specific pages to strategically optimize their chosen cities. Markup was added to important pages. and index request was sent to google once site health was above 90%. Out of the 40 keywords per city for 5 cities, more than 30 made #1 in the first and second largest cities while the other 3 cities began to catch traction within two months after indexing request to Google. <br><br>

            I chose to showcase this one above my independently made websites because it highlights our cooperation as a team to create something that our client called "one of the best sites he's seen in the business"!
