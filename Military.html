										<h3>2012-2016 Combat Medic (68W)</h3>
										<p>Enlisted 6 months after graduating high school because i wasn't sure exactly what i wanted to do. The family carpentry business was definitely not for me. College at the time was also something I did not want to consider because I was afraid of taking up too much debt without even having an idea about what i wanted. I knew I wanted to help people and maybe make a difference in their lives so work in the medical field seemed linke the right choice. </p>
										<p>After training, I was stationed in Fort Carson CO under the 4th infantry division 204 Brigarde Support Battalion with whom I deployed to Kuwait to provide medical aid to injured troops coming from Iraq and Afghanistan. I was later attached to the famous 36 engineer Regiment's second platoon where my job was senior medic in charge of 3 junior medics and supervision of over $1,000,000 dollars worth of equipment.</p>

											<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
											<p>The Army was more than just a stepping stone to what I would move on to do in life. Patience, consistency, motivation comes after action and never before were drilled into me from the very beginning. I learned valuable lessons in collaboration and teamwork with people that I didn't necessarily like to accomplish the mission. I learned to compromise and adjust to situations at hand wile maintaininng my military bearing at all times. Learning that different people need to approached in tactfully but in different ways to get the best reults The biggest takeaway however, was learning the ever so valuable lesson of leadership and how a keystone principle of learning to follow before you can lead. These priciples have become core tenants for my life post military.  </p>

											<h3>Army Rakkasan Marathon | Kuwait</h3>
											<p>While on deployment, when there is so mission, the only thing there is to do is to workout, eat at the food court, and workout some more. During my time deployed, I ran a marathon in 3:05:00 with no prior training as to honor the WWII 187th Infantry POWs, the "Rakkasans", that were forced to walk miles upon miles to their deaths under Japanese capture .</p>
